# hand-skitch-for-new-robort-handing-in-prochor
The new idea in my design is that the robot could walk between the people in an event by motors. Three motors per leg needed. image 1 will ilusterate the idea of lower part of the rebort while image 2 will show the idea of how the robort will hand in the paper by using one hand. by using one hand the robort could only oick up the paper and rise it up in front as he give it. the idea is there will be four leaders in front of the robort the level of his hand will jump from first  leader to the fourth leader downword way. image 2 will illusterate the idea further.
